## 📁 CORRECT IMAGE STRUCTURE

```
images/
└── {year}/           # e.g., 2024/
    ├── {stream}-sem{n}.webp           # Main semester curriculum
    ├── {stream}-sem{n}-1.webp         # Multipart (if exists)
    ├── {stream}-sem{n}-2.webp         # Additional parts
    └── {stream}-{n}.webp              # Additional resources
```

### ✅ Examples
